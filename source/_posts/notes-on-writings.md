# WEEK 2: Euthyphro

Plato and Socratic.

* 年代分类
    * Early/Middle/Late
* Socratic: be accused for religious renovation.
* Euthyphro: against common opinion
* "Socratic irony"
* 核心：piety (敬神)
* "the form itself"
    * Eg. the very idea of beauty; the Idea of beauty; the concept of beauty
    * = what it is.
    * 希腊语中 form 与 idea 为同一词。

## Definitions of  PIETY

1. piety = dear to the god*s*/god-loved (impious = god-hated)
2. piety = dear to *all* the god*s* (impious = hated by all the gods)

> Common sense: if someone has done something wrong, he should be punished.
>
> To make disagree with something, they must agree with something "deeper" (eg., common language.)
>
> (8e) Even gods disagree.

> God-loved vs Being god-loved
>
> 1. god-loved "iff" being god-loved
>
> 2. god-loved is not being god-loved
>
> 3. eg.:
>
>     *A* is affected/changed *because* it is being affected/changed (√)
>
>     *A* is being affected/changed *because* it is affected/changed (×)

  * 1. If a thing is god-loved, it is god-loved *because* it is being god-loved.

  * 2. *A* pious thing is being god-loved because it is pious, not the other way.

      (vs. *Divine Command Theory*: conversed)

  3.  *Hence*, it is **not** the case that piety = loved by (all) the god.

3. (use justice concept) the part of justice to *care* gods.

    1. what is *care*? (关心？照顾？)

        => service

    2. craft/art?

    3. trade

    Back to Def. 2.

# WEEK 3: Virtue

Thesis: virtue is knowledge.

## Meno 

Debator’s argument.

* Doctrine of recollection

    Claim: latent knowledge $\longrightarrow^\textrm{''teaching''}\longrightarrow$ actual knowledge

    面积问题：

    * 辅助线是否算一种 teaching

    - knowing how vs. knowing that (cf. *The Concept of  Mind*)

    * Pre-existing knowledge (eg. Greek/language)

        *Backgrounds* 的重要性。

* Immotality of soul

## Phaedo

* Philosophy: Activity vs Theory/Doctrine

    soul–body dualism (Plato) / mind–body dualism (Descartes)

    soul: 强调 ethic/religion (灵魂；相对的：肉身)

    * ethical aspect
    * interlectural aspect

# WEEK 4

🕊了

# WEEK 5

笛卡尔

- Med. 1: Doubt
- Med. 2: I think, (therefore,) I am.
- Med. 3: God
- Med. 4: Truth & Falsity
- Med. 5: Ontological proof of God
- Med .6: distiction between mind and body

## Med. 1: Reasons for doubt

* Sensory
* Possibility of dreaming
* an Evil Demon

## Med. 2

think/perceive

* broad sense: doubting/wanting/imagining/sensory percepting

* narrow sense: pure thinking

# WEEK 6

## The wax argument (Med. 2)

What is the *essence* of body?

Method: stipping off *in thought* the inessential to reveal the “naked”  essence

First qualities & Second qualities

|        | Know of the Existence of ... |  Know of the Essence of...   |
| :----: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| minds  |              T               | T (thinking & non-extended)  |
| bodies |              F               | T (extension & non-thinking) |

##  The existence of God (Med. 3)

- Rule of Clarity and Distincty
- nature
    - natural impulse (blind)
    - natural light (of reason)
        - basically Rule of C&D
        - for essence
        - needs the existence of God, but Descartes uses it to prove the existence of God.

### idea*s*

Modes of thought/thinking.

- Strict sense: as it were *images* of things

    The idea of $X​$ resembles(/represents/pictures/…) $X​$.

- possible origin of ideas: innate, adventitious, invented

- formal reality ($F$) (intrinsic reality) / objective reality ($O$) (representational content)

    [reality here links to perfection]

    > The reality of cause is not less than that of effect (by the Rule of C&D)
    >
    > $R_\textrm{cause} \geq R_\textrm{effect}​$

    All ideas are modes of thought, therefore, they only have objective reality

    *Hence*,  $R_\textrm{unitmate total cause of idea of $X$} \geq R_\textrm{idea of $X$}​$

    *And*, $R^F_\textrm{ultimate total cause of idea of $X$} \geq R^O_\textrm{idea of $X$}​$

    Defense for $O \to F$: The ultimate total cause of idea should not be idea. (?)

    Since right hand sides is infinite, left is infinite, and actual, which is defined as God.

# WEEK 7: PROOF OF AN EXTERNAL WORLD

by G. E. Moore

*An* external world: Only need to prove part of external world.

*External*: external to us $\Rightarrow$ external to our minds.

- things as they are in themselves (transcendental sense)

- things as they appear to us (empirical sense)
    + distinguish with “things to be met with in space”: consider shadow

        - distinguish with “things presented in space”: consider after-imagines, *pains*

            + private 

                for pains: can two have the same pain?

                c. f. PI SS253

            + space: non-physical (for after-imagines); ? (for pains)

            + dependent on perception

        - need to be *pubilc*: its existence is independent from individual perception

            + objective: its existence is independent from perception in general

            + What about a rainbow and the sky?

        - space: physical

Proof: which sense?

- demonstration (original): point out something clearly.


# WEEK 11

- How is virtue acquired?

- A: By habitation (approx. training: a. action; b. feelings) 

    You learn X by doing X.

- The genus of moral virtue: it is a state of character, not a passion, nor a capacity
- pleasent: about invariables: the best things: as the object is better

# WEEK 12: *Groundwork*

I. Kant: systematic, architectronic

- Rational cognition (approx. philosophy/systematic knowledge/science)

    - 康德的分类：

        - Formal: concerns only the *forms* of thought, not the *concepts* (subject-matter) of thought.
            - *Logic*
        - Material (substantive/substantial)
            - *Physics* (subject-matter: nature, what happens)
                - pure (necessary/*a priori*) and empirical
            - *Ethics/moral philosophy* (subject-matter: norm, what *ought to* happen)
                - must be pure to be philosophy
                - event = happening
                    - action: a special kind of events. Connected to *will*.

        |           | physics    | ethics              |
        | --------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
        | laws of … | nature     | freedom/will/action |
        |           | desriptive | prescriptive        |

        - Some cognition is both pure (*a priori*) and material (synthetic):
            - arithmatic, Euclid geometry
            - “Every event/happening has a cause.”

- Sec. I

    non-consequentialist

    a good will comes from / is base on pure reason

    - practical love: beneficence from duty
    - pathological love: dependent upon sensibility

    Golden Rule: maxim that can be universalized (adapted by all rational beings.)

# WEEK 13: *Groundwork* (cont’d)

|               | in accordance with (but not from) duty | from duty |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------- |
| immediate     |                                        |           |
| non-immediate |                                        |           |

- hypothetical / catogorical

（跳过功利主义）

# WEEK 14：Nietzsche

Nietzsche, Marx, Freud: philosophy of suspicion.

- Good n Bad: master morality, Romans, active, aristocratic, noble

- Good n Evil: slave morality, Jew, passive, democratic, “small”

Psychological defence mechanism

# WEEK 15：Nietzsche

‘Guilt’ & ‘Bad Conscience’

- Promises —conditions:

1. ability to think about past and future;
2. ability to hold one’s own words; (responsibility / freedom of will)

Active memory: to achieve promises

- forgetfulness: natual instinct

$\Rightarrow$ taming: social straight jacket

- Punishment:

1. related to revenge 
2. (retributive justice)
3. community / state
4. pleasure in cruelty

- 德语中 guilt 与 debt 同源

# WEEK 16: PF Strawson: FREEDOM AND RESENTMENT

determinism vs morality

Def schematci thesis: There is a single sense of ‘determinism ’ such taht all behavior is determined at that same sense.

pessimist: imcompatism

optimist: compatism

the skeptic: morality is unreal

Strawson:

1. Opt. is right but superficial (just consider morality as punishment).

2. Pess. is deep but wrong.
3. right and deep.

- human relationships, esp., inter-personal relationships (person := rational animal) matters
- resentment, forgiveness, love =: reactive attitudes
- we demand a certain degree of good will.
- pleas
    - action-directed pleas
        - participant attitude
        - objective attitude
    - agent-directed pleas
        - short term
        - long term

> The question, then, of the connection between rationality and the adoption of the objective attitude to others is misposed when it is made to seem dependent on the issue of determinism. But there is another question which should be raised, if only to distinguish it from the misposed question. Quite apart from the issue of determinism might it not be said that we should be nearer to being purely rational creatures in proportion as our relation to others was in fact dominated by the objective attitude? I think this might be said; only it would have to be added, once more, that if such a choice were possible, it would not necessarily be rational to choose to be more purely rational than we are.
