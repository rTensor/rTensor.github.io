# WEEK 2 -- Euthyphro

Plato and Socratic.

* 年代分类
    * Early/Middle/Late
* Socratic: be accused for religious renovation.
* Euthyphro: against common opinion
* "Socratic irony"
* 核心：piety (敬神)
* "the form itself"
    * Eg. the very idea of beauty; the Idea of beauty; the concept of beauty
    * = what it is.
    * 希腊语中 form 与 idea 为同一词。

## Definitions of  PIETY

1. piety = dear to the god*s*/god-loved (impious = god-hated)
2. piety = dear to *all* the god*s* (impious = hated by all the gods)

> Common sense: if someone has done something wrong, he should be punished.
>
> To make disagree with something, they must agree with something "deeper" (eg., common language.)
>
> (8e) Even gods disagree.

> God-loved vs Being god-loved
>
> 1. god-loved "iff" being god-loved
>
> 2. god-loved is not being god-loved
>
> 3. eg.:
>
>     *A* is affected/changed *because* it is being affected/changed (√)
>
>     *A* is being affected/changed *because* it is affected/changed (×)

  * 1. If a thing is god-loved, it is god-loved *because* it is being god-loved.

  * 2. *A* pious thing is being god-loved because it is pious, not the other way.

      (vs. *Divine Command Theory*: conversed)

  3.  *Hence*, it is **not** the case that piety = loved by (all) the god.

3. (use justice concept) the part of justice to *care* gods.

    1. what is care? (关心？照顾？)

        => service

    2. craft/art?

    3. trade

    Back to Def. 2.
